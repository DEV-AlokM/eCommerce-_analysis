# Business Insights Report - Advanced README

This repository contains the code for generating a **Business Insights Report** from customer and transaction data. The report uses **Python**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **fpdf** libraries to extract, visualize, and analyze important business insights. The insights are then saved in a **PDF format** that includes visualizations and recommendations based on the data.

## Key Features
- **Customer Distribution by Region**: Visualizes the regional distribution of customers and spending.
- **Top Product Categories**: Analyzes the most popular product categories.
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: Plots monthly sales trends to identify peak periods.
- **Top 10 Customers**: Identifies the top 10 customers based on total transaction value.
- **High-Priced Products Underperforming**: Highlights products priced above $100 with low sales.
- **Repeat Customers**: Identifies customers with repeat transactions.
- **Region with Highest Transactions**: Identifies regions with the most transactions.
- **Potential Market Expansion**: Recommends regions for potential business growth.
